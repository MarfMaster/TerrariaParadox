AltLibrary:
- Make alternatives work with support from this library
- Add evil jungle grass support to the lib?: setting evil jungle grass doesn't allow it to spread to mud blocks in pre-hardmode(corrupt grass spreads only to mud in pre-hardmode, can't take over jungle grass)
                                           --->make evil jungle grass spread to empty mud blocks in pre-hardmode
                                             in hardmode evil jungle grass can infect jungle grass very slowly, but still can't spread to mud 
                                           --->make evil jungle grass spread faster in hardmode
                                             a corrupt grass block can also spread to empty mud, turning it into corrupt jungle grass, while normal grass can't spread to mud and create normal jungle grass
                                           --->make evil grass spread to empty mud blocks at all times
